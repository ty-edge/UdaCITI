    <h1>My HTML Notes</h1>

    <p><strong><em> Markup</em></strong> is text with special meaning. <mark>It is used to stylize HTML code.</mark> It is comprised of <em>tags</em> that encompass an element. The tags represent how the element should be displayed in a web page.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Tags</em></strong> generally appear in pairs of opening and closing tags, which look like this "<"openning tag example">" and "<"/closing tag example">"</p>

    Mary had a little toad<br>
    Its skin as tough as shell<br>
    And every file that toad would write<br>
    It used HTML.<br>

	This Udacity Course has been great. Thus far, we've had an introduction to the course and instructors and have covered many topics. To date we have done the following:
    		<ol> 
      			<li> Meet Your Instructors </li>
      			<li> Course Outline </li>
      			<li> Introduction to the Web and HTML </li>
    		</ol>
    	Additionally, we have learned about some really interesting HTML concepts, such as: 
    		<ul> 
      			<li> Using markup to add tags to help form the structure of our page </li>
      			<li> Which tags require closing and which don't </li>
      			<li> The difference between inline tags and block tags </li>
      			<li> How to incorporate lists and other structural elements into our pages </li>
    		</ul>
    	</p>
    	
	<p>
    	Based on what we've learned thus far, two examples of elements that have optional closing tags are the paragraph <'p'> and list item <'li'> tags. 
    	</p>
    	
	<p>
    	When you leave off a closing tag, the closing of the tag is implied as the browser knows it wouldn't be possible to open a new tag without first closing the optional tag and thus, will insert the closing tag for you. While this is allowed by the browswer, it is much easier for you and other developers to read and follow your code when tags that can be closed are explicitly closed. 
    	</p>
    	
	<p> Another thing that we did was practice creating nested lists. We toyed with a nested list about animals. Here's the example we used: 
      		<ul>
          		<li>Mammals
              			<ol>
                  			<li>Raccoons</li>
                  			<li>Gorillas</li>
              			</ol>
          		<li>Reptiles
              			<ol>
                  			<li>Iguanas</li>
                  			<li>Cobras</li>
              			</ol>
          		<li>Birds
             			<ol>
                  			<li>Ostriches</li>
                  			<li>Ravens</li>
              			</ol>
      		</ul>

  	Learning with Udacity has been a blast so far!<br><br>
	I would highly recommend checking out this program for anyone interested in becoming a full-stack web developer: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/citi-scholarship-program/">UDACITI</a>
  	</p>

	Another thing we learned is how to add images to the webpages that we design. This can be done with a relative URL for an image that is locally stored or an Absolute URL for an image that can be accessed via server like these: 
  	</p>
  	<img src="https://placebear.com/800/600" alt="BEARISH">
	<img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/200/300" alt="A picture of my favorite actor in his prime.">
